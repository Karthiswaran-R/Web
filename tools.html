        <h2>Setting Up Linux</h2>
        <p>Follow these steps to install Linux using virtualbox :</p>
        <p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to install Ubuntu Linux in VirtualBox:

Prerequisites:

VirtualBox installed on your system.

Ubuntu ISO file (download it from Ubuntu's official website).


Steps to Install Ubuntu in VirtualBox:

1. Download and Install VirtualBox:

Download VirtualBox from the official website.

Run the installer and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.



2. Create a New Virtual Machine:

Open VirtualBox.

Click on the New button to create a new VM.

Name the virtual machine (e.g., “Ubuntu”).

Select Linux as the type and Ubuntu (64-bit) as the version.

Click Next.



3. Set Memory (RAM):

Assign memory (RAM) to the VM. A recommended size is 2048 MB (2 GB), but you can allocate more depending on your system’s resources.

Click Next.



4. Create a Virtual Hard Disk:

Select Create a virtual hard disk now and click Create.

Choose the VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) option for the hard disk file type and click Next.

Select Dynamically allocated for the storage on physical hard disk, and click Next.

Set the size of the virtual hard disk. A size of 20 GB is typically enough, but you can adjust it based on your needs. Click Create.



5. Configure the VM Settings:

Select the newly created VM and click Settings.

In the System tab, you can configure boot order and other settings, but the default configuration should work fine.

In the Storage tab, click the Empty disk icon under the Controller: IDE section.

On the right side, next to Optical Drive, click the disk icon and select Choose a disk file.

Browse to and select the Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded earlier.



6. Start the Virtual Machine:

After setting everything up, click OK to save the settings and then click Start.

The VM will boot from the Ubuntu ISO file.



7. Install Ubuntu:

Once the virtual machine boots up, you will see the Ubuntu installation screen.

Select your language and click Install Ubuntu.

Choose your keyboard layout and click Continue.

When prompted, select Normal installation and click Continue.

Choose the installation type (usually Erase disk and install Ubuntu, since it’s a virtual disk) and click Install Now.

Follow the prompts to set your time zone, user details (username and password), and other settings.

Click Continue to start the installation process. It may take some time.



8. Complete the Installation:

Once the installation is complete, you will be asked to restart the VM. Click Restart Now.

When prompted, remove the installation disk (ISO) by going to the Devices menu in VirtualBox and selecting Optical Drives > Remove Disk from Virtual Drive.

Click Enter to reboot.



9. Log into Ubuntu:

Once Ubuntu starts, you will be prompted to log in. Use the username and password you set during installation.




Now, you have Ubuntu running in VirtualBox!

Feel free to install any necessary tools or configurations based on your project needs.
